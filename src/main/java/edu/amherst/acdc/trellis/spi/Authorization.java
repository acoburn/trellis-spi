/**
 * This interface provides access to data defined in an WebAC Authorization graph. Access to a resource can be
 * controlled via WebAccessControl, an RDF-based access control system. A resource can define an ACL resource
 * via the Link header, using rel=acl. It can also point to an ACL resource using a triple in the resource's own
 * RDF graph via acl:accessControl. Absent an acl:accessControl triple, the parent resource is checked, up to the
 * server's root resource.
 *
 * An ACL resource may contain multiple acl:Authorization sections. In an LDP context, this may be represented with
 * ldp:contains triples. Another common pattern is to refer to the acl:Authorization sections with blank nodes.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl">W3C WebAccessControl</a>
 * and <a href="https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec">Solid WebAC specification</a>
